# **Chat app💬**
It's my web application written using flask-socketIO

Right now basic chat functionality is working and I'll add more features soon(also css styles😎)!
## **This program contains:**

Web Registration Page wchih use Postgresql for register and accessing users to Databse, is connected with Heroku via URI
Password is protected with Hash function adding 16b salt and 29,000 iterations by default

## **TODO:**

- deploy at http://zstefaniuk.pl/ (half done, registration workig wery well! but unforunately online chat is bugged)

- instal SLL certificate(hopefully websockets will be working)

- fix not working rooms

- add css code to stylize for better UX

- sending photos feature

- automatic scrolling down when user send message to show new one

- various bugfix

**The best is yet to come ✌🏻 Stay tuned!**

Best Regards **Zayn!**
